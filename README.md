# awesome-backdoor
A collection of the most creative and fancy backdoors for post-exploitation 

# Brief

The goal of this repository is to collect a list of the most creative ways to maintain persistence in a post-exploitation step.

With time I'll try to keep the list updated with the most interesting techniques found around.

The collection is divided by Operating System (2 atm).

- [Windows](Windows/MAIN.md)
- [Linux](Linux/MAIN.md)

Each of the folders contains `General` and `Root` payloads.
The `General` folder will contain payloads that can be used for both `user` and `root` privileges, while the `Root` directory is only for root privileges. For windows, `Root` means administrative privileges.

> The goal of this repo is not to create fully undetectable backdoors for malicious purposes but only to keep track
> of the most interesting and creative ones that can eventually be used in `CTF` or authorized Penetration Tests.
> Also, this repo contains code and exploits that can harm your machine, so be careful with this.
> I do not assume any respnsability for illegal purposes.

# Contribution
